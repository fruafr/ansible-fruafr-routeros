# ansible-fruafr-routeros

Ansible collection for Mikrotik RouterOs

## Purpose

The purpose of this collection is to provide Ansible roles to perform high-level tasks on Routerboard such as configuration, import and export of backups.

It is NOT officially supported by Mikrotik. Use it at your own risk.

Does not support answers to prompt questions due to limitation in [community.routeros/issues/42](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/issues/42)
